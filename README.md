## Telecom Domain 5G Launch Data Analysis Dashboard

### Overview

AtliQo, a leading telecom provider in India, launched its 5G plans in May 2022, alongside other major telecom companies. Post-launch, the management noticed a decline in active users and revenue growth. To address these concerns, the business director requested a comprehensive analysis comparing key performance indicators (KPIs) from the periods before and after the 5G launch. The goal is to gain insights that will help the company recover its active user base and improve other critical metrics. Additionally, the management is interested in exploring the potential to optimize internet plans to attract more users.

### Objective
